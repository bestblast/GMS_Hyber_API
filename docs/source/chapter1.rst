   Kinds of Viber Messages

The type of Message is defined by parameters that are specified in your request (Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3). 

Viber provides Two-way Communication - the User can respond to your Messages as well as has option to initiate the conversation (Section 6.1).

When the Message can not be delivered to Viber, the multichannel messaging platform Hyber can use lower-priority option and deliver the Message to SMS channel.

You can use more than one Viber ID. The parameter <alpha_name> is required to be specified in your request. It determines which Viber ID is used (Section 2.3). The <alpha_name> link to the Viber ID is configured on GMS side.

Operators of some countries allow to send transactional Messages only with a pre-registered text template. For the list of these countries, refer to your account manager. A description of the query parameters is provided in Section 2.3.
