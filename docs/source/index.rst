**What is an API?** 

An application programming interface is a software tool, typically used to ease the creation of other software or to relay information or instructions between different programs and applications. 

GMS uses APIs to – among other things – allow clients to link their CRM with our A2P messaging solutions or construct a Viber advertising campaign.
